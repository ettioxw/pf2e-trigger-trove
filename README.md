# PF2e Trigger Trove
A compilation of triggers to use with the [PF2e Trigger](github.com/reonZ/pf2e-trigger) module.

## How to use?
Enable the module and you will see this module's triggers. They are **disabled** by default, and you should only enable triggers that you plan on using.
## Contribute
PRs are welcome! If you want to contribute a trigger to the module. Here's a step-by-step guide.
1. Create your trigger inside Foundry.
2. Export your trigger out of Foundry.
3. Open your export and copy the *object* corresponding to your trigger.
4. Edit the `triggers/pf2e-trigger-trove.json` file and paste your trigger inside the `triggers` array.
5. Submit a PR with your changes.
I will then review your trigger, likely testing it out on my own and request changes as needed.
